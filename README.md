Cube 1: Made using a wireframe material in color facade.  
Cube 2: Made using a phong material given to me.  
Cube 3: I interpolated between blue and green using the given shader.  
Cube 4: I interpolated between black and pink using my own shaders.

Cube 1: Made using a simple rocky texture map.  
Cube 2: Made using a rocky texture map as well as a corresponding matching normal map.  
Cube 3: Made using a red/pink texture map with its matching normal map.  
Cube 4: Made using a texture loaded in through my fragment shader.  
Cube 5: Made by using conditionals in the fragment shader to create four different subsections in the texture for each quadrant.

In this lab, I chose to do part 1, the game in Unity. I changed the skybox color to be a bright blue instead of the original purple   color. I then changed the material of the checkpoints to be more metallic and orange instead of purple as well. I manipulated some of   the prefabs to create a giant tree in the middle of the track as well as some obstacles along the track as well. I created yellow   particles by creating a new material for the particle system and also changed the kart's color as well.

A point light is a light that is located in a point in space and emits light in all directions equally.  
A spot light is a light with a range and specified location that emits light in a cone in a specific direction.  
A directional light does not have a specific location and exists as a sort of sun light infinitely far away that emits light in a single direction.  
An area light is a rectangle in space that only emits light from one side of the rectangle.  
  
The object I found in the real world was a brick wall. I created this material in Unity by looking for a normal map and texture map for a brick wall and applying it to a 3D capsule object.  

In my lab, I have added two addition textured objects: a palm tree and a garbage can.  

I have added a daytime skybox as well to my scene.

I made this scene by incorporating a customized mesh formed through a Unity shader graph. Within it I created a mountain terrain via the use of nodes inside the shader graph. To create the water waves, I coded a shader file that made use of a cosine function to imitate the motion of ocean waves. For finishing touches, I added trees, a light source, and some additional assets like a bike and character to flesh out the scene.  

Unfortunately, I was unable to properly reach my partner, but I'm sure his project would have been interesting to look at and observe!

I was inspired by my hometown San Francisco and wanted to really capture the beauty of the night sky and the buildings at night. I made sure to add in the streets and familiar roads as well as some tiles textured with water.  
  
Unfortunately, I was unable to properly reach my partner, but I believe he also did well on his project!  

# lab9

The rule I used to create this L-System was based off of the Sierpinski Triangle one, but changed so that it used the Sierpi≈Ñski arrowhead curve L-system instead. It makes use of A and B to draw forward, + to turn left, and - to turn right. Turns are conducted at a 60 degree angle each turn.
