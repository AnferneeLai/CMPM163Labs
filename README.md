Cube 1: Made using a wireframe material in color facade.  
Cube 2: Made using a phong material given to me.  
Cube 3: I interpolated between blue and green using the given shader.  
Cube 4: I interpolated between black and pink using my own shaders.

Cube 1: Made using a simple rocky texture map.  
Cube 2: Made using a rocky texture map as well as a corresponding matching normal map.  
Cube 3: Made using a red/pink texture map with its matching normal map.  
Cube 4: Made using a texture loaded in through my fragment shader.  
Cube 5: Made by using conditionals in the fragment shader to create four different subsections in the texture for each quadrant.
